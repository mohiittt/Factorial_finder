# Factorial_finder

A factorial is the product of all the numbers up to a value, starting from 1.

For example, factorial 5 would be 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

## Write a function that:
1. Starts at the highest number.
2. Multiplies that by factorial of itself minus one
3. Terminates when it reaches 1 and returns 1
4. Outputs the factorial.
